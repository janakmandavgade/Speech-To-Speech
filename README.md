# Speech-to-Speech & Text Pipeline

A Flask-based web application that allows users to record or upload an audio file and receive a natural language response from a Large Language Model (LLM). The application processes speech input (converting it to text), sends it to the LLM, and then converts the LLMâ€™s text answer back to speech.

## Features

- **Audio Input:** Users can record their voice or upload an audio file.
- **Speech-to-Text Processing:** Converts the audio into text.
- **LLM Interaction:** Sends the transcribed text to an LLM for processing and response generation.
- **Text-to-Speech Output:** Converts the LLM's response into audio for playback.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly UI built with Flask for seamless interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) (recommended)
- FFmpeg installed on your system (for audio processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
    ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
## **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add below configuration variables.
 
**For example:**

   ```code
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<KEY>
   HF_TOKEN=<KEY>
   COHERE_TOKEN=<KEY>
   ```
